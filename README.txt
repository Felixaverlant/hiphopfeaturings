hiphopfeaturings
================
# Description
Hip hop featurings is a project to display a network of collaborations between artists.

# Raw Data stats
It is based on spotify's api data.
I gathered:
- 68580 artists
- 74543 featurings

# Methodology description
Then I used Gephi to analyze the graph and to perform simple network algorithm analysis.

Node sizes and Layout is based on Page Rank and colors on Gephi's modularity cluster (~60 clusters).

Based on that I extracted the most meaningful links and artists.

# Web viz data stats
The displayed graph has:
- 13721 artists
- 37628 featurings


NB: It was impossible to display all artists and featurings on a web interface.
